# Expo WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync iOS Simulator Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` from Expo doesn't function correctly on the iOS simulator.  The function returns an error instead of opening the URL in a browser. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected functionality on other platforms.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project on an iOS simulator.
3. Observe that clicking the button does not open a browser, instead it logs an error to the console.

## Expected Behavior

The URL should open in the default browser of the iOS simulator.

## Actual Behavior

An error is returned from `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync`. The error may vary depending on the simulator and Expo version.

## Solution

The issue is likely due to a configuration problem in the simulator or Expo's handling of the iOS simulator.  A potential workaround or fix is not currently available. The solution file is under development.
